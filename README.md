# Jobs-App-C


This will be my attempt at creating a job organization app for my friend to use so that he can have people create an enquiry for a quote for a trades job. He can then have all the jobs organised in one location and be able to manage the jobs form there. 


I will try to use as much of the Dev ops lifecycle as I can remember from when we did it earlier in the year and then add them into a dedicated folder for the development of the app.

The app will be made using MySQL and C# and MAUI/React Native for the mobile app.

I will need to investigate how to have MAUI run on HTTPS and also how to deploy it and then have people be able to download it.
